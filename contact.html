    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p class="About me" style="text-align: center">
      A recent alumnus of <i>California State University Bakersfield</i>, I
      carry passion for all things technical alongside a deep desire to learn.
      <br />
      My main goal in employment is to positively expand my way of thinking —
      specifically in terms of problem solving — <br />
      and to retain the greatest amount of expert knowledge as possible. <br />
    </p>
    <p class="About me" style="text-align: center">
      I take responsibility standing, am willing to accept fault, and use the
      lessons learned to further build a sturdier foundation of comprehension<br />
      and professional work ethic. I have found that I am competent in both
      working solo or with others; as I improve, so do those around me.<br />
    </p>
    <p class="About me" style="text-align: center">
      I am looking forward to working as part of your team.<br />
    </p>
