        <p class="About me" style="text-align:center;">
            A recent alumnus of California State University, Bakersfield, I carry passion for all things technical alongside a deep desire to learn.<br>
            My main goal in employment is to positively expand my way of thinking, specifically in terms of problem solving, and to retain the greatest<br>
            amount of expert knowledge as possible.<br>
            <br>
            I take responsibility standing, am willing to accept fault, and use the lessons learned to further build a sturdier foundation of comprehension<br> 
            and professional work ethic. I have found that I am competent in both working solo or with others; as I improve, so do those around me.<br>
            <br>
            I am looking forward to working as part of your team.<br>
        </p>
